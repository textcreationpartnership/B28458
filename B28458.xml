            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS Humbly Offered for the Relief of the Hackney-Coachmen.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS, in the Act for Regulating Hackney and Stage-Coaches, the Stage-Coaches were to Pay <hi>Eight Pounds</hi> a Year, by Quarterly Payments; and those Licenses expiring with the Year, they may, as it seems, Drive where they please, without a License, out of the <hi>Bills of Mortality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there being about Four Hundred of these Stage-Licenses, It is Proposed, That they may be Licensed for One and Twenty Years, Paying <hi>Eight Pounds</hi> every Year, to be imployed towards the Discharge of the Transport-Ships, or otherwise, as your Wisdoms shall seem meet; and that some Act may be passed to that Purpose, or some Clause added to some other Act for that End, that none may Drive, either in the Town, or Countrey, without their <hi>Figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, Whereas several Rich Men, who have got Licenses for Keeping Hackney-Coaches, endeavour the having Liberty to Drive in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey without <hi>Figures:</hi> Above 600 of the Licensed Hackney-Coachmen here in Town, who have paid their Fines, and have large Families, do humbly desire, that no Hackney-Coachmen may have Liberty to Travel without their <hi>Figure;</hi> and for that purpose they make the Proposal above-written: For if such Liberty to Travel without <hi>Figure</hi> be allow'd, there will always be 700 Coaches in Town, which will be very pernicious to the Poorer Sort, by reason of their being over-Numbred; and the Rich Men, who can keep Ten or Twelve Horses, will have much the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all the rest; and the Poor Men and Widows, who cannot keep above Two or Three Horses (can only work in Town) will be utterly undone: Whereas, if their <hi>Figures</hi> are imployed for Countrey Journies in the Summer, there will be more Work for the Poorer Sort, who can only serve in the Town, which are above 600.</p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly hoped, That either all Drivers in the Countrey may be Licensed as Stage-Coaches, and none may Drive there without License; or else, that no Licensed Hackney-Man may Travel into the Countrey without their <hi>Figure.</hi>
